## Howdy! Welcome to my blog!

I've always wanted to start a blog but I never could figure out what to write. I finally took blogging off the pedestal it was propped up on and here we are. My goal for this site is to be a resource for *me*, to help me remember things I did from the past and to document any challenges I come across. If the content helps someone else along the way, that's just the cherry on top.

I wanted to learn [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), so that's what I did. This site is built on Gatsby. I followed the main tutorial and tweaked it a little to suit my needs. I then followed the tutorial and launched this blog on Gatsby's hosting platform. It's hooked right into the Github repo so anytime I push a change to the main branch, Gatsby builds and deploys the latest changes automatically. That last bit is probably my favorite part and deploying this site was a breeze.

Gatsby uses React to build out the UI. I'm not a React developer (at least not yet, :D), but I am loving the flexability and simplicity of it all. Angular is my go-to framework for building web apps but with Gatsby I was able to kill two birds with one stone, learn a new framework and some dev-ops along the way.

I'm still making minor adjustments to this site, specifically the styling. Other than that, the only updates I'll be making to the site is providing blog articles. In Gatsby it's pretty straightforward, although not really user friendly. To create a new article I have to add a new .mdx file to my site. It would be awesome to build out a user interface to add articles but that's a lot of work at the moment. I have many other side-projects I am working on. So, editing and creating .mdx files isn't a big deal.

That's all for now. I hope to add some more content in the near future. See ya around!
